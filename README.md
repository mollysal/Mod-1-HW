# <HTML CSS Challenge>

## Description

A marketing agency wants a codebase that follows accessibiltiy standards to ensure that the site is optimized for search engines. 
The HTML needed semantic elements to allow higher ranking within web searches.
I learned to utilize semantic elements and modify another users code.

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

## Credits
